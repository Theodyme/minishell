to do:

	X tab de pointeurs sur fonctions pour les builtins
	- printing of export
	X function that convert from linked list to char **


what if:

	X ! YOU CANT UNSET PWD
	- export "ok           ok" needs to be: "ok ok"
	- export on its own


unset specifics:

	X unset the first var
	X unset something that doesnt exist
	X unset something that doesnt exist but has the start of a real var (ex: unset USE instant of USER)

echo specifics:

	- multiples		only fill the last file but erase the previous it passes through

cd specifics:
in usage:		int chdir(const char *path);

	- cd 			switch to home
	- cd .			stay there (but chdir nonetheless?)
	- cd ~username	switch to username's home
	- cd dir		switch to dir subdirectory (/user/tmp)
	- cd /dir		switch to dir directory (/tmp)
	- cd ..			switch up one directory
	- cd -			switch to previous location
